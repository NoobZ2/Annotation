# Tkintertoy

Tkintertoy was designed to be a easy to use GUI library based on Tkinter.
It was intended for "young" (as in experience) programmers to develop GUIs
with as little trouble as possible. However, more "advanced" programmers can
reach the more complex features of Tkinter easily. Here is a short example:

    from tkintertoy import Window
    gui = Window()
    gui.setTitle('My First Tkintertoy GUI!')
    gui.addEntry('name', 'Type in your name')
    gui.addLabel('welcome', 'Welcome message')
    gui.addButton('commands')
    gui.plot('name', row=0)
    gui.plot('welcome', row=1)
    gui.plot('commands', row=2, pady=10)
    while True:
        gui.waitforUser()
        if gui.content:
            gui.set('welcome', 'Welcome ' + gui.get('name'))
        else:
            break

This code will create a small window with an entry, label, and command button
widgets. The application will wait for the user to type in their first name.
After typing it in, and clicking on Ok, the application will display a welcome
label. The user exits the code by clicking on Cancel.

While Tkintertoy was designed to be an GUI library for simple interfaces it
has been used in more complex code as well. 

Using Tkintertoy, it is hoped that Python instructors can quickly move students
from boring command-line applications to useful standard GUIs. A tutorial with
many useful examples in included with the documentation.
